Red dashed line corresponds to the \tocheck{$\riftNoiseFloorPercentile$}th percentile of the distribution, which was used as the threshold for significance.

    \caption{Whole-brain patterns of ImCoh between extracted ROI time series (brain-brain ImCoh) can be explained by two point-like sources located in V1 of both hemispheres using CTF. (A) In the two-stimuli passive viewing condition of the RIFT dataset, there was a $\pi/2$ phase delay between time courses of luminance modulation for the presented stimuli. (B) The lead field of the dipole configuration that yielded the best fit for the CTF-based model. (C) CTF- and distance-based approaches explained comparable variance in the raw values of brain-brain ImCoh, but CTF also partially explained the difference between pipelines for ROI extraction (delta). The correlation values were computed across pooled data from three data-independent extraction pipelines. (D) Theoretical predictions based on CTF and estimates of brain-brain ImCoh from real data are positively correlated for all considered pipelines. For all panels, we used the data from the experimental condition with full luminance modulation (tagging type 1) and random starting phase.}
